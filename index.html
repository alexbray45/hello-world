<h2>Bio</h2>
 <p>My name Alex Bray, I am 21-year-old Ghanaian living in Botswana, I was born in Ghana and grew up here in Botswana throughout my life. I currently study at the Botswana Accountancy College. My best interests lie within sports, computers, music and games. I have been good at sports activities from a young age, namely football and athletes and I have represented my school at tournaments during my years in high school. 
One of my favourite things to do as my hobby is making music. I started piano lessons at the age of 10 and it has grown from there. My favourite genres I listen to are namely Hip-hop, R&B/Soul, Afro Beats and Gospel, these genres influence the type of music I make and i enjoy creation process too. My music inspirations come from various artists such as Drake, H.E.R, Bryson Tiller, Burna Boy as well as music bands such as The Compozers. My dream is to become a music producer, that will support my future career and will enhance my musical abilities and my technological skills and one of my career aspirations is to become a Software developer or a Technopreneur. 
I enjoy watching movies and especially tv series, these include Bulletproof, Power, Ballers, All American and local series such as the river and the queen, there are countless of them, it will take forever to name them all, LOL. From most of the people I have interacted with, they find me as a quiet, calm, compassionate and Initiative person.
