<h2>Bio</h2>
 <p>
  My name is Alex Bray, I am 21-year-old Ghanaian living in Botswana, I was born in Ghana and grew up here in Botswana throughout my life. I currently study at the Botswana Accountancy College. My best interests lies within sports, computers, music and games. 
  I have been good at sports activities from a young age, namely football and athletes. I have represented my school at tournaments and won a number of awards during my years in high school which has developed me as a person and as athlete as well. 
  One of my favourite things to do as my hobby is making music. I started piano lessons at the age of 10 and it has grown from there. My favourite genres I listen to are namely Hip-hop, R&B/Soul, Afro Beats and Gospel, 
  these genres influence the type of music I make and enjoy as well as the creation process too. 
  My music inspirations come from various artists such as Drake, H.E.R, Bryson Tiller and Burna Boy but what really inspired me to start music was a music band in our church, i was fascinated by how different type of instruments could be combined together to make one beautiful track.
  My dream is to become a music producer, that will support my future career and will enhance my musical abilities and my technological skills and one of my career aspirations is to become a Software developer or a Technopreneur. 
  I enjoy watching movies and especially tv series, these include Bulletproof, Power, Ballers, All American and local series such as the river and the queen, there are countless of them, it will take forever to name them all, LOL. From most of the people I have interacted with, they find me as a quiet, calm, compassionate and Initiative person.
